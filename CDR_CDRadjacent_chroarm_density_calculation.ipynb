    "This code snippet uses parallel processing to calculate the modification density for different sets of chromosome regions using the `region_read_mA_density_calculator` function. It iterates over the list of dictionaries (`bar_plot_dataset`), each containing different sets of chromosome regions, and their corresponding names (`bar_plot_dataset_names`). For each dictionary, it calls `region_read_mA_density_calculator`, passing the dictionary, its name, the BAM file, and the modification tag ('A'). The results are saved to CSV files named according to the dataset names.\n"
