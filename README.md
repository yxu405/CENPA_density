# Dimelo seq mA calculator
 This script is used to calculate mA density in different given regions. The code takes different genome coordination files. 
 The first section takes in the bam file and the reference genome, so that the script cancalculate the chromosome sequence length for each and every chromosome for later analyses. 

 The second part of the script parses the active array into the format of
